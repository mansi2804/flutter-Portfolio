## Summary and Reflection

For this MP2, I created a user profile page with sections like "Contact," "Education," "Projects," and "About Me." I used a UserInfo data model class to organize user information and employed various Flutter widgets such as Column, Row, and Container for layout. I included seven images and implemented nested widgets for better organization, along with scrolling functionality in the projects card to improve navigation. However, I encountered challenges with scrolling and layout overflow.

I enjoyed designing the profile page and experimenting with different layouts. The process was rewarding, but debugging layout issues was challenging. I wish I had a better grasp of Flutter's layout system beforehand. Overall, this project helped improve my Flutter skills and taught me the importance of clear code organization.
